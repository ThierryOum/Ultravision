    <p class = "p1">When you're ready for serious business, power-on to the Master Keyboard. Our state-of-the-art Microprocessor and the RAM packed (64K) internal components (expandable to 128K) turn this system into one of the most powerful computers on the market.<br> When the business gets tiresome and you want some real excitement, choose one of our 12 action-packed games ... they'll blow you away. And don't feel sorry if you have a large library of Atari VCS, or ColecoVision games, because you can enjoy them through our expansion modules.<br> This revolutionary system doesn't just claim to duplicate the arcade experience... it surpasses it! And it's portable too, A/C or D/C. Plus 3 dimensional graphics, zoom and other special visual effects. The unique built-in sound system simulates echo and reverberation for authentic reproduction of explosions, crowds, music, etc. And you can hear it all without disturbing others. As a Color TV, it's better than most, with 2 independent systems to guarantee the sharpest resolution for the Computer/Game Systems and TV.</p class =p1>
